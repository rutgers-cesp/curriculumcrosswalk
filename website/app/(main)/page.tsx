                    Finding the right introductory computer science curriculum for middle school students is crucial for
                    educators. The Rutgers Middle School Introductory CS Curriculum Crosswalk has been developed to
                    simplify this process by providing detailed information on eight different curricula. This tool
                    helps teachers by presenting key facts about each option, including its approach to teaching
                    computer science, whether through games, storytelling, or other engaging methods.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-3 text-base text-muted-foreground">
                    The crosswalk offers a clear course description from each curriculum provider, access to their
                    website, details about the curriculum's structure, the programming languages used, and how the
                    lessons are organized. It also covers practical details like the cost for classroom use, how the
                    curriculum was funded, how often it's updated, and what kind of training is available for teachers.
                    This straightforward approach allows educators to quickly compare different curricula, understand
                    what each one offers, and decide which is best suited to their students' needs and their teaching
                    goals.

            <Collapsible header="Curriculum Selection & Review Methodology">
                <p className="mt-3 text-base text-muted-foreground">
                    The selection of curricula for this tool was guided by a comprehensive web search targeting middle
                    school computer science course curricula. The top 200 search results were considered, which were
                    then examined for inclusion based on several criteria: the researchers' familiarity with the
                    curriculum, its popularity, and the availability of materials for review. Only curricula
                    specifically designed for middle school students were considered. Furthermore, to qualify, a
                    curriculum had to be intended for use in a classroom setting as a complete program, rather than
                    offering isolated lessons or materials that could be selectively incorporated into an existing
                    course. When a provider offered multiple qualifying curricula, the earliest (in course sequence)
                    introductory course was selected for inclusion. It's important to note that some curricula were not
                    included in this tool due to the absence of freely accessible documents online for review. The
                    information presented in the tool was derived from documents or lesson plans publicly available
                    online, with reasonable assumptions made based on the documentation available.
